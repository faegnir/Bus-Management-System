# Bus-Managment-System
A simple (turkish) bus managment system written in C language.
It has .txt files, menu functions etc. 
You can add bus, add voyage to those bus and simply become bus corpo. 
Then as a client you can see those voyage you added, choose one of them and make a reservation and see your reservation.
Its written in Turkish and i don't have time to translate it to english, sorry for that.
You can do whatever you want with the code.
Since im freshman at university any suggestions about how to improve my code is appreciated.
